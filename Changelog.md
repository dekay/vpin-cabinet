- Cleaned up *most* of the problematic clones in the drawing. Still a few left to do. This has a lot of benefits because the Transform tool doesn't like how I had them initially, so you couldn't use it to move things around.
- The routed glue blocks for the undercab LEDs are now properly shown. LED strips have been moved around appropriately.
- Floating shelves for the power and controller shelves are now in. The wooden blocks that support them have a foam strip on them to minimize conduction of vibration and to minimize stiffening the cabinet (important for SSF operation)
- Cleaned up the fuse block options on the power shelf to the type that I bought. Moved the Mean Wells to the power shelf to get them off the side of the cab and potentially interfere with SSF. Now the supplies are right next to the fuse blocks. Moved the power shelf around to get it out of the way of the playfield support and the rear HDN-8s
- Got rid of the KL25Z stuff because....

TODO
- draw the Pinscape Pico on the controller shelf
- move the ZK-TB21s to the underside of the controller shelf to free up room for the Pinscape Pico
- finish getting rid of the problematic clones in the drawing
- Figure out some mounting system for the Mean Wells
