# Changelog

**2026-01-16**
- Cleaned up the last of the problematic clones in this drawing. Drudgery. So much drudgery.
- Major updates to the ~~KL25Z~~ Pinscape Pico-based Controller Shelf.
  - PC boards are to scale
  - Added some nice routed slots for the wiring
- Major updates the Power Shelf
  - Mean Wells are now mounted on their edge on either side of this shelf with 3D printed brackets
  - Fuse blocks now properly show
  - Added some nice routed slots for the wiring
- Cleaned up some errors that the Recompute function was finding. It doesn't make the recompute any faster, but at least the errors are gone :-(
- ZK-TB21s and isolators are now moved to the underside of the Controller Shelf. They are currently defying gravity and hanging in mid-air but the intention is to design up some 3D printed brackets for these too. I have a few ideas on that.
- Added a picture of this thing to the Readme page. Finally.
- Note that the Controller Shelf at 8.5" deep looks like it could be trimmed down a couple inches. I think this will end up being the case but leaving my options open for now.

- Cleaned up *most* of the problematic clones in the drawing. Still a few left to do. This has a lot of benefits because the Transform tool doesn't like how I had them initially, so you couldn't use it to move things around.
- The routed glue blocks for the undercab LEDs are now properly shown. LED strips have been moved around appropriately.
- Floating shelves for the power and controller shelves are now in. The wooden blocks that support them have a foam strip on them to minimize conduction of vibration and to minimize stiffening the cabinet (important for SSF operation)
- Cleaned up the fuse block options on the power shelf to the type that I bought. Moved the Mean Wells to the power shelf to get them off the side of the cab and potentially interfere with SSF. Now the supplies are right next to the fuse blocks. Moved the power shelf around to get it out of the way of the playfield support and the rear HDN-8s
- Got rid of the KL25Z stuff because....
