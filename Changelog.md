# Changelog

- Fixed a stupid error where the playfield shelf was too long and would interfere with the lockdown bar receiver. Shortened it by half an inch.
- Replaced the Coin Door Position Switch holder STL I grabbed off the web for my own part designed in FreeCAD. The STL version was too flimsy and would flex when the door closed. It was also undersized for the switch I had bought. I also tweaked it for a #8 pan head screw.
- Replaced the STL mount for the USB3 extension on the Computer Drawer I grabbed off the web for my own part designed in FreeCAD. The STL was again flimsy and didn't fit the part I had bought - mine had a narrower gap between the ports.
- Replaced the Mean Well power supply mount STL with my own part designed in FreeCAD. The STL version had too big a gap for the power supply and it tended to flop around a bit.
- Shortened the Controller Shelf by 1.75" (and forgot to move the shelf support accordingly. D'oh!). I'm trying to maximize space in the middle of the cab for what I hope will be a future box for the sub. Note that the sub may not remain at the 8" shown and could drop down to a 6.5". We shall see.
- Moved around various things to reflect how the build is going so far
  -  Rear BST1 is a half inch closer to the Computer Drawer
  -  Mean Wells are now closer to their respective fuse blocks. I'm trying to free up room to make access to the fasteners easier.
  -  Parts on the computer shelf have been shuffled around a little. Biggest change here was flipping the power supply so the air inlet now pulls air from the front of the cab instead of the motherboard.

And yes... this does mean that I'm now actually putting this bad boy together. Good times!

- Cleaned up the last of the problematic clones in this drawing. Drudgery. So much drudgery.
- Major updates to the ~~KL25Z~~ Pinscape Pico-based Controller Shelf.
  - PC boards are to scale
  - Added some nice routed slots for the wiring
- Major updates the Power Shelf
  - Mean Wells are now mounted on their edge on either side of this shelf with 3D printed brackets
  - Fuse blocks now properly show
  - Added some nice routed slots for the wiring
- Cleaned up some errors that the Recompute function was finding. It doesn't make the recompute any faster, but at least the errors are gone :-(
- ZK-TB21s and isolators are now moved to the underside of the Controller Shelf. They are currently defying gravity and hanging in mid-air but the intention is to design up some 3D printed brackets for these too. I have a few ideas on that.
- Added a picture of this thing to the Readme page. Finally.
- Got the leg braces in the proper orientation. One pair was upside down
- Note that the Controller Shelf at 8.5" deep looks like it could be trimmed down a couple inches. I think this will end up being the case but leaving my options open for now.

- Cleaned up *most* of the problematic clones in the drawing. Still a few left to do. This has a lot of benefits because the Transform tool doesn't like how I had them initially, so you couldn't use it to move things around.
- The routed glue blocks for the undercab LEDs are now properly shown. LED strips have been moved around appropriately.
- Floating shelves for the power and controller shelves are now in. The wooden blocks that support them have a foam strip on them to minimize conduction of vibration and to minimize stiffening the cabinet (important for SSF operation)
- Cleaned up the fuse block options on the power shelf to the type that I bought. Moved the Mean Wells to the power shelf to get them off the side of the cab and potentially interfere with SSF. Now the supplies are right next to the fuse blocks. Moved the power shelf around to get it out of the way of the playfield support and the rear HDN-8s
- Got rid of the KL25Z stuff because....
